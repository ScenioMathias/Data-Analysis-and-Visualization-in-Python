# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-in-Python

Hello everyone! This is a repository where I'll be presenting introductory knowledge in data visualization and analysis using the Python language.

Data visualization and analysis are fundamental tasks. After cleaning and processing the data, we perform visualization and analysis to relate information and obtain valuable insights.

For this material, I used a basic dataset containing city, GDP, and expenditure data. Through this dataset, I was able to analyze how the data is distributed using graphs and also to relate information. This allows for making data-driven decisions.
